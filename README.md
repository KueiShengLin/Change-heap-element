# Change-heap-element
change the tuple item in the heapq h

> Input heapq h and need changed tuple item(x,y)
> This process will find the element (a,y) in the heap, change the a to the x and adjust the heap
> Output the new heap that change the old item to the input item

>This process can not use if item have the same tag

> Time complexity
>> Searching item O(n)
>> Adjust heap O(logn)
